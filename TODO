* Some subtitles versions work fine with some 720p version 
   (eg: LOL works with 720p DIMENSION)
   This is not yet supported.
* When the name of a show is typoed or not complete, parse the
   database to propose the user some plausible using JaroWinkler
   distance so he can rerun subito with replace option
* When applciation is unable to download an subtitle file, tell the
   reason why in verbose mode (eg: no team given, name not found in database etc...)

* Manage the case when connection is done with a proxy

* Replace yml database by an sqlite one (started)
   Optimize database creation
   Maybe change the way things are done : insert show in database as
   new shows subtitles search is processed
